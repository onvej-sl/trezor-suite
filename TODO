* Find and resolve all TODOs (`grep -R TODO packages/branch-and-bound/`, `grep -R TODO packages/coin-selection/`).
* Find and consider implementing all optimization suggestions (`grep -R 'Optimization suggestion' packages/branch-and-bound/`, `grep -R 'Optimization suggestion' packages/coin-selection/`).
* Better distribute classes into files.
* Fix all linter errors. In particular the following:
  * iterators/generators require regenerator-runtime, which is too heavyweight for this guide to allow them. Separately, loops should be avoided in favor of array iterations
  * File has too many classes (6). Maximum allowed is 1
* Integrate the coin selection algorithm to coin send dialog.
* Check auxiliary files such as the following:
  * jest.config.js
  * package.json
  * tsconfig.json
* Decide what to do with the recursive implementation of the branch and bound algorithm.
